Data understanding and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Goals of EDA
  - Understand feature types: numerical, categorical, time-based features, and derived metrics.
  - Identify data quality issues: missing values, inconsistent encoding, and outliers.
  - Explore relationships between features and the fraud target.
  - Detect potential leakage or data drift patterns that could bias results.
- EDA workflow
  - Data summary: shape, dtypes, missing value patterns, and basic statistics.
  - Univariate analyses: distributions for numeric features, category counts for categorical features.
  - Bivariate analyses: correlations, mutual information, and feature-target relationships.
  - Time-aware analyses: seasonality, weekly patterns, and event-driven spikes.
  - Visual storytelling: pair plots, heatmaps, violin plots, and bar charts that reveal signal structure.
- Example insights you might uncover
  - Certain merchant categories show higher fraud incidence, guiding feature creation.
  - Transaction amount distributions differ between legitimate and fraudulent cases.
  - Feature combinations (e.g., time of day plus device type) reveal stronger fraud signals than individual features.
- Data quality actions
  - Normalize inconsistent encodings for categorical features.
  - Impute or engineer features to handle missing values without introducing leakage.
  - Flag and inspect rare categories that could degrade model performance.

Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Goals
  - Prepare data for robust learning.
  - Create features that capture domain signals while staying interpretable.
  - Reduce noise and handle class imbalance appropriately.
- Core preprocessing steps
  - Type normalization: ensure numeric types are consistent; encode categoricals with label encoding or one-hot encoding as appropriate for LightGBM.
  - Missing value handling: imputation strategies tailored to feature type.
  - Time features: extract meaningful time-based signals (hour of day, day of week, holiday indicators if available).
  - Normalization: scale features only when necessary; tree-based models like LightGBM handle raw numeric ranges well.
- Feature engineering techniques
  - Target encoding for high-cardinality categoricals (careful to avoid leakage in cross-validation).
  - Frequency encoding to capture category prevalence.
  - Interaction features: combinations like user history, device, location, and merchant patterns.
  - Aggregations: rolling stats by user, merchant, or card type to summarize behavior.
  - Ratios and deltas: relative measures such as amount-to-average, time since last transaction, and velocity features.
  - Binary flags: indicators for suspicious patterns or policy-driven signals.
- Feature selection mindset
  - Start with a broad feature set and prune via cross-validated performance.
  - Monitor feature importance from LightGBM to refine the feature set.
  - Guard against overfitting by favoring stable signals across folds and by limiting leakage.
- Feature reproducibility
  - Record feature generation steps with clear versioning.
  - Use deterministic operations and fixed seeds where randomness is involved.
  - Document any external data sources used for feature creation.

Modeling approach with LightGBM
- Why LightGBM
  - Fast training on large tabular datasets.
  - Good handling of categorical features and missing values.
  - Built-in support for early stopping and robust cross-validation.
- Model setup
  - Objective: binary classification, with a focus on precision and recall trade-offs aligned to fraud detection needs.
  - Evaluation metric: ROC-AUC as a global signal; F1 or precision-recall AUC for threshold-sensitive evaluation.
  - Hyperparameters: learning_rate, n_estimators, max_depth (or tree depth), num_leaves, subsample, colsample_bytree, min_child_samples, reg_alpha, reg_lambda.
  - Categorical features: LightGBM can handle categories efficiently with a proper categorical feature specification.
  - Class imbalance handling: adjust scale_pos_weight, use SMOTE variants as needed, or implement cost-sensitive learning through objective and evaluation metrics.
  - Cross-validation: stratified K-fold to preserve fraud proportions across folds.
- Training workflow
  - Split data into train/validation/test sets with careful consideration to time-based ordering if applicable.
  - Train with early stopping on the validation set to avoid overfitting.
  - Track metrics per epoch, with a focus on stability and generalization.
- Interpretability and monitoring
  - Use feature importance and SHAP values to understand model signals.
  - Provide global and local explanations to support investigations and policy decisions.
  - Build simple dashboards or reports that translate model outputs into actionable items.

Handling class imbalance
- The challenge
  - Fraud cases are typically a small fraction of transactions.
  - Imbalance can bias models toward predicting the majority class.
- Techniques
  - Resampling: SMOTE and its variants to balance classes in the training data.
  - Cost-sensitive learning: assign higher weight to fraud instances in the loss function.
  - Stricter thresholds: adjust the decision threshold to meet business goals for precision or recall.
  - Ensemble methods: combine multiple models to stabilize performance.
- Practical guidance
  - Always evaluate on a holdout set that resembles real-world class proportions.
  - Monitor stability of performance across folds and over time.
  - Avoid overfitting to synthetic samples; ensure synthetic data remains representative.
  - Use business metrics alongside standard ML metrics to guide threshold choices.

Model evaluation and interpretation
- Evaluation framework
  - Use ROC-AUC as a primary measure to gauge ranking performance.
  - Use precision, recall, F1, and PR-AUC to understand performance under class imbalance.
  - Inspect confusion matrices at chosen thresholds to balance false positives and false negatives.
  - Analyze calibration to ensure predicted probabilities align with observed frequencies.
- Interpretability tools
  - SHAP values to quantify the contribution of each feature to a prediction.
  - Global explanations to identify overall signal drivers.
  - Local explanations to explain individual fraud alerts for investigators.
- Validation practices
  - Time-aware splitting if data has temporal structure.
  - Nested cross-validation when tuning hyperparameters to prevent optimistic estimates.
  - Robustness checks across different data windows and subsets.
- Reporting and dashboards
  - Build clear reports that summarize model performance and key signals.
  - Present insights in business terms: what features matter, how thresholds affect risk, and where to focus investigations.

Reproducibility and experimentation
- Versioning
  - Keep data, features, and model code under strict version control.
  - Record dataset versions, feature generation scripts, and model configurations.
- Experiment tracking
  - Maintain a simple, auditable log of experiments: date, parameters, metrics, and observations.
  - Use fixed seeds for all randomness in preprocessing and modeling steps.
  - Store artifacts: trained models, feature importances, and evaluation reports.
- Environment and dependencies
  - Use a reproducible environment (requirements.txt, Pipfile, or Conda Environment).
  - Pin library versions to avoid drift in behavior.
- Testability
  - Create small, fast tests for data processing, feature engineering, and model scoring.
  - Validate that changes do not degrade performance on the holdout set.

Deployment considerations and business insights
- Deployment options
  - Batch scoring: nightly or hourly processing of streams of transactions.
  - Real-time scoring: low-latency scoring for live alerts, if needed.
- Operational concerns
  - Monitoring: track drift in data distributions and model performance.
  - Alerting: design alert workflows for high-risk events and investigation queues.
  - Governance: ensure compliance with privacy, data protection, and fraud regulations.
- Actionable business outputs
  - Prioritized alert lists for investigators based on risk scores.
  - Explanations that support decision-making and reduce investigation time.
  - Policy recommendations: when to tighten rules, suspend accounts, or request additional verification.
- Risk management
  - Define fallback plans if model performance deteriorates.
  - Establish thresholds and guardrails to avoid runaway false positives.
  - Align model outputs with user experience goals and customer trust.
